# Developing on the Microsoft Platform
Slides and content for the _Developing on the Microsoft Platform_ presentation.

### Abstract
In the past few years, Microsoft has gone back to it's roots, a platform company. In doing so, they've open sourced many things, created a great Cloud, and are refocusing on developers. In this session we will cover their platform offering from a software engineer/developers' perspective. We'll discuss [.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/about), [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/), and the [Azure cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/). If you're written off Microsoft (M$) in the past, I encourage you to attend the session and see what the newMicrosoft is all about.
